• Suppose we have developed a very large application that
includes many modules. As the number of modules grows, it
becomes difficult to keep track of them as they have similar
names or functionality.
• It is necessary to group and organize them by some mean
which can be achieved by packages.
• A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines
a single python application environment that comprises of
modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages and so on.
• Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module
namespace using dot notation.
• Packages are a way of structuring many packages and modules
which help in a well organized hierarchy of data set, making
the directories and modules easy to access.
• A package is a collection of python modules i.e. a package is a
directory of python modules containing an additional _
_init_ _.py file. E.g Phone/_ _init_ _.py

• To create a package in Python, we need to follow these three
simple steps:
1. First, we create a directory and give it a package name,
preferably related to its operation.
2. Then we put the classes and the required functions in it.
3. Finally we create an __init__.py file inside the directory, to let
Python know that the directory is a package

Using Standard PackagesMath:
• Some of the most popular mathematical functions are defined in
the math module. These includes trigonometric functions,
representation functions, logarithmic functions and angle
conversion functions.
• Two mathematical constants are also defined in math module.
• Pie( ∏ ) is a well known mathematical constant which is
defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a
circle and its value is 3.141592653589793
NumPy:
• NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing
with python.
• NumPy stands for “Numeric Python”.
• It provides a high performance multidimensional array object
and tools for working with these arrays.
